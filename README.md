# Falling Platforms

Simple game made in pygame. Your goal is to survive as long as possible and avoid traps.

The base game was made in a week, so don't expect anything spectacular. There-fore code is really messy.

Tested on python 3.12

## Controls
- You can move using WSAD or arrows
- Your main goal is to avoid traps.
- Try to survive as long as possible.
- Your personal best time will be displayed when you die.

## How To Run
1. Clone the repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdamBurdik/Falling-Platforms.git
```
2. Navigate to directory
```bash
   cd Falling-Platforms
```
3. Run the game
```bash
   python main.py
```

## Plans
- My main plan for future is to rework game idea and make something more rogue-like.
